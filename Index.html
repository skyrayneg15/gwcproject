  <p><strong>Endangered Species</strong> are groups of animals in immediate danger of becoming <strong>extinct</strong>, or died out. Animals may become threatened or endangered because of a loss or change in habitat, over-exploitation, predation, competition, disease, disturbance or contamination. In New Jersey, there are many endangered animals that need your help! By learning about these animals and why they have become endangered, you are already taking steps to make a difference. If we work together, maybe we can save these animals!</p>
<p><h4>Our Mission</h4></p>
<p> The goal of this website is to teach you about endangered animals in New Jersey. We also want to let you know that it is possible for you to make a difference. It is possible for you to save these animals if you try! You also can prevent future problems, like having more species face endangerment. Share this information with your family and friends. Together, we can save the animals and change the world!</p>
<p><h4>Game!</h4></p>
  <p>Click the green flag to start the game then use the arrow keys to guide the sea turtle back to the ocean to save him! Avoid hitting the walls and the dogs! Your goal is to reach the yellow star!</p>

       <p4>The Indiana Bat hibernates during the winter seasons. Their diet consists of bugs and insects. This species uses
         echolocation to locate their prey. Indiana Bats are sometimes woken up out of hibernation because people invade their
         roosting site and purposely kill the bats. </p4>

  <h3>Why Are These Animals Endangered?</h3>

    <p>Many animals in New Jersey, like the ones you have previously learned about, are endangered for many different reasons. The main reasons are the following: habitat loss/changes, over-exploitation, predation, competition, disease, and disturbance/contamination. It is important to learn about species’ problems causing endangerment and extinction so that we are able to stop the current problems and prevent future problems.</p>

  <p><h4>Habitat Loss/Changes </h4></p>
  <p>Habitat changes or habitat losses are a major threat to many species of animals. This is when the places where animals live, such as forests or plains, are destroyed or impacted by humans. Humans often do this so that they can build or farm on the land. To fix this problem, protected areas are established to save species and their natural habitats. However, habitat loss continues to be a major problem as humans continue to expand their needs. </p>

    <p9 class="center">(Sparkman, Kevin)</p9>
  <p><h4>Over-exploitation</h4></p>
  <p>Over-exploitation is the overuse of wild animal and plant species by people. An example of over-exploitation would be overfishing or overhunting. Humans kill animals for food, other products, and for sport. It becomes over-exploitation when humans kill too many animals of a species, which often causes endangerment.

<p9 class="center">(Gonzalo)</p9>
  <p><h4>Predation </h4></p>
  <p>Predation is the relationship in which the predator, like the lion, eats the prey, the zebra. Predation causes the population of both predators and prey to balance. Therefore, the two depend on each other. If there is less prey population for the predator, then the predator population decreases as well. The balance of predation in nature affects populations. Human involvement affects populations also, so if one population is affected, then its predator or prey population is affected as well. </p>

<p9 class="center">(Yong, Ed)</p9>
  <p><h4>Competition </h4></p>
  <p> Competition is the interaction between animals when they require the same resource, such as food. The two types of competition are interspecific and intraspecific. Interspecific is competition between animals within a species. Intraspecific is competition between animals of different species. Both types of competition affect populations of species, since animals fight for their resources. </p>

<p9 class="center">(Wilkin, Douglas)</p9>
  <p><h4>Disease</h4></p>
  <p> Disease and illnesses often threaten wildlife populations greatly. Animals spread different dangerous diseases among animals in their species as well as among animals in different species. This may result in excessive animal deaths leading to endangerment and extinction. </p>
<img src="https://odh.ohio.gov/wps/wcm/connect/gov/59f13305-da3f-41a9-b8b5-ba7aa586128e/for-disease.jpg?MOD=AJPERES&CACHEID=ROOTWORKSPACE.Z18_M1HGGIK0N0JO00QO9DDDDM3000-59f13305-da3f-41a9-b8b5-ba7aa586128e-mrF.vGI" alt="Disease" style="width:400px;height:300px" class="center">
<p9 class="center">(Ohio Department of Health)</p9>
  <p><h4>Contamination</h4></p>
  <p>Contamination is the presence of undesirable substances in the natural environment. Contaminants often cause pollution in many forms. This is caused by human action such as litter, pesticides and fertilizer, burning of fossil fuels, and other forms of impurities. The effects are drastic, including garbage patches, algal blooms, acid rain, and water pollution. This not only affects the animals, producing endangered and extinct species, but it also impacts humans, causing disease and environmental destruction.</p>

  <h3>What Can You Do To Help Them?</h3>
  <h2>There are many ways you can help protect these animals
    and bring them off of the endangered list. </h2><h2 >Here's how you can help save the world!</h2>

  <p9 class="center">(NOAA)</p9>
  <ul>
      <p2><li>Educate your family and friends about endangerment and extinction in your area.</li>
      <li>  Try to not buy or use plastic products, as they tend to find their way into the ocean, harming our aquatic wildlife.</li>
      <li>Do your part to share the beach with certain animals, like the
  Piping Plover, because they tend to breed on certain parts of the beach. If you
  take your pets to the beach, make sure to keep a close eye on them.
    Dogs can be
 a threat to certain endangered beach animals, like the piping plover and the Ridley
  Sea turtle.</li>
      <li>When driving on the roads, drive carefully and be alert for any wild Animals
 that may be on the street, especially at night. </li>
      <li> Do not purchase any clothes that are
  made from animal fur.</li>
      <li> If you see trash on the ground, pick it up and throw it in the
 trash or recycling bins.</li>
      <li>Volunteer at local organizations that help clean up the
environment and/or help the animals.</li>

<p><i>The Bald Eagle's Success Story</i></p>
  <img src="https://www.nydailynews.com/resizer/qZrtPLaSHf1jD7A0CBn6AHYCBUo=/1200x0/top/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4PDJV2EMWZH5TBWQNMUDWCTGPA.jpg" alt="Bald Eagle" style="width:400px;height:300px" class="center">
  <p9 class="center">(Sommerfeldt, Chris)</p9>
<p>The bald eagle is an iconic symbol for the United States. In the 1960's and 1970's, however, the bald eagle population became a concern due to the counry's excessive use of a synthetic insecticide called DDT. The bald eagle population grew after DDT was banned and the species was protected under the Endangered Species Act. In 2007, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed the Bald Eagle from the federal endangered species list.</p>
